# 0.1.5 Introducing nREPL support

The `rebel-readline-nrepl` package offers nREPL support.

For detailed information, please refer to the `../rebel-readline-nrepl/README.md`. This library is separate (`[com.bhauman/rebel-readline-nrepl "0.1.5"]`) to keep startup time for `rebel-readline` lean.

Support for a command-line interface (CLI) is now available through both `rebel-readline.main` and `rebel-readline.tool` entry points, along with the ability to specify a configuration file.

Other updates include:
* b11eaf8: Introduction of a :neutral-screen-theme
* 9773dab: Enhanced lightweight Ctrl-C interrupt handling
* Fixed issue #219: Removed lazy loading of packages

# 0.1.4 Removed regex stack overflow for large strings

It is very confusing to get an error from the value printer, so this merits a release.
